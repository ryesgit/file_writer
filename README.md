# File Writer
This program will ask the user for sentences to write to a file.
If the user has no more sentences to add, the program terminates.

1. Ask the user for the filename. If no parameters given, filename will default to mylife.txt
    - If a file already exists, open that file.
    - If the file is new, create a new one.
2. Ask the user for input, and then append that input to the file.
3. Remember to close the txt file! (Use with operator for a foolproof execution!)
